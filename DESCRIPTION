Description: A collection of functions for modelling mutations in pedigrees with 
    marker data, as used e.g. in likelihood computations with microsatellite data.
    Implemented models include proportional and stepwise models, as well as random 
    models for experimental work, and custom models allowing the user to apply any 
    valid mutation matrix. Allele lumping is done following the lumpability criteria 
    of Kemeny and Snell (1976), ISBN:0387901922.
